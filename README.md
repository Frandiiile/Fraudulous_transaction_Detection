# Fraudulent Transactions Detection

Welcome to the Fraudulent Transactions Detection project repository! This project is dedicated to detecting and preventing fraudulent transactions using various machine learning models. It also provides a web interface powered by Streamlit, allowing users to test their custom models online.

## Project Overview

Fraudulent transactions can cause significant financial losses and impact the security of financial systems. In this project, we aim to:

- Build, train, and evaluate multiple machine learning models for fraud detection.
- Provide Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- Deploy the best-performing models as a web application for real-time fraud detection using Streamlit.
- Offer users the capability to upload and test their own custom models online.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/` : Stores the dataset for training and evaluation.

- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

- `web_app/` : Houses the Streamlit web application for fraud detection.
